    <h2>About India</h2>
    <p>
        India is the largest country in the South Asia Region, located primarily in the center of the subcontinent. The country shares land borders with Pakistan to the northwest, China and Nepal to the north, Bhutan to the northeast, and Bangladesh and Myanmar are to the east. Maritime borders in the Indian Ocean exist with Sri Lanka to the south, Maldives to the southwest, and Indonesia to the southeast.

        The Republic of India is the seventh largest country in the world by area and, with over a billion people, is second only to China in population, although its much higher birth-rate makes it likely to reach pole position in less than ten years.
        
        It is an extremely diverse country, with vast differences in geography, climate, culture, language and ethnicity across its expanse, and prides itself on being the largest democracy on Earth and a hub of trade in Southeast Asia. India provides a vast canvass for touring whether it may be cultural, adventure, religious, history, beach, wildlife and other forms.
